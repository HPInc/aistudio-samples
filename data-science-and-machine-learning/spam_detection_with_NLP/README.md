## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Step 0: Minimum Hardware Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the minimum compute requirements for smooth image classification performance:

- **RAM**: 16 GB  
- **VRAM**: 4 GB  
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU

### Step 1: Create an AI Studio Project

- Create a new project in [Z by HP AI Studio](https://zdocs.datascience.hp.com/docs/aistudio/overview).

### Step 2: Set Up a Workspace

- Choose **Deep Learning** as the base image.

### Step 3: Download the Dataset
1. This experiment requires the **tutorial_data dataset** to run.
2. Download the dataset from `s3://dsp-demo-bucket/tutorial_data/` into an asset called **tutorial** and ensure that the AWS region is set to ```us-west-2```.

### Step 4: Clone the Repositoryy

```bash
https://github.com/HPInc/aistudio-samples.git
```

- Ensure all files are available after workspace creation.

## üöÄ Usage

### Step 1: Run the Notebook

Execute the notebook inside the `notebooks` folder:

```bash
notebooks/spam_detection_with_NLP.ipynb
```

This will:

- Load and prepare the data
- Peform a Exploratory Data Analysis
- Preprocess the Text and Vectorize
- Train a Model
- Evaluate the Model
- Train Test Split
- Create a Data Pipeline
- Integrate MLflow
